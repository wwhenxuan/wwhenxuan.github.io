## üëã About Me

I graduated from the School of Artificial Intelligence in [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/) and am currently pursuing a master's degree in the School of Telecommunications Engineering and a member of the State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks.

## üîç Research Interests

My current research interests focus on deep learning based **Time Series Analysis (TSA)** and Modern Signal Processing.
I am passionate about building time series foundation models because I believe time series are external representations of complex dynamical systems, and we are able to distil relevant insights about the real physical world from the models. 
Subsequently, my research work will gradually transition from traditional TSA to **Complex Systems Modeling** and **Scientific Discovery**.

## üî• News

- **[Jun. 2025]** My undergraduate thesis was rated as an outstanding thesis of Xidian University.
- **[Oct. 2024]** [PySDKit](https://github.com/wwhenxuan/PySDKit): We have developed and open-sourced the first integrated Python library for signal decomposition.
